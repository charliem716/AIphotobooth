## ‚ú® **Enhanced AI Image Generation**

The AI Photo Booth now uses **enhanced DALL-E prompts** specifically optimized for photo booth scenarios. The system generates themed artwork that captures the essence of photo booth photography while transforming it into your chosen cartoon style.

### Current Implementation
- **Smart Prompting**: Enhanced prompts that understand photo booth context (1-4 people, close-up portraits, friendly expressions)
- **Style-Specific Details**: Each theme includes detailed style guides for authentic transformations
- **Retry Logic**: 3 attempts with exponential backoff for reliable generation
- **MMS Delivery**: Full-resolution images sent directly to phones

### üöÄ **Future Enhancement: GPT-4o Vision**
**Coming Soon**: Integration with GPT-4o's vision capabilities to:
- Actually analyze the captured photo before transformation
- Preserve exact number of people and their positions
- Maintain clothing colors and poses in the themed transformation
- Create more accurate, personalized results

The infrastructure is ready for this upgrade when the MacPaw OpenAI SDK fully supports vision APIs.
