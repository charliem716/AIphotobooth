   cp env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your actual API keys
   ```

3. **Configure your .env file**
   ```
   OPENAI_KEY=sk-your-openai-api-key-here
   TWILIO_SID=ACyour-twilio-account-sid
   TWILIO_TOKEN=your-twilio-auth-token
   TWILIO_FROM=+1your-twilio-phone-number
   ```

4. **Build and run**

## Development Timeline

Following the 5-day MVP plan:
- **Day 0**: Project setup ‚úÖ
- **Day 1**: Camera integration
- **Day 2**: UI and countdown
- **Day 3**: AI and SMS integration
- **Day 4**: External display
- **Day 5**: Polish and testing

## Troubleshooting

### Camera not detected
- Check iPhone is unlocked
- Verify Continuity Camera is enabled
- Try reconnecting (click refresh button)
- Restart both devices if needed

### API errors
- Verify credentials in .env file
- Check API quotas/credits
- Ensure internet connection

### MMS not sending
- Verify phone number format (+1 for US)
- Check Twilio account balance
- Ensure number is MMS-capable
- Check image upload service availability

## Security Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: This MVP stores API credentials locally. For production:

## ‚ú® **GPT-4o Vision-Powered AI Image Generation**

The AI Photo Booth now uses **GPT-4o vision capabilities** to actually analyze captured photos before generating themed transformations. This creates much more accurate and personalized results.

### Current Implementation
- **GPT-4o Vision Analysis**: Actually analyzes the captured photo to understand people, poses, clothing, and setting
- **Intelligent Prompting**: Generates DALL-E prompts based on real photo analysis rather than generic templates
- **Fallback System**: Graceful fallback to enhanced static prompts if vision analysis fails
- **Retry Logic**: 3 attempts with exponential backoff for reliable generation
- **MMS Delivery**: Full-resolution images sent directly to phones

### How It Works
1. **Photo Capture**: iPhone via Continuity Camera captures the photo
2. **Vision Analysis**: GPT-4o analyzes the image for people, poses, clothing, expressions, and setting
3. **Smart Prompt Generation**: Creates a DALL-E prompt that preserves the actual scene composition
4. **Style Transformation**: DALL-E generates the themed artwork based on the real photo analysis
5. **MMS Delivery**: Users receive the personalized AI-generated photo

### Benefits
- **Accurate People Count**: Preserves the exact number of people in the photo
- **Pose Preservation**: Maintains the actual poses and positioning from the original
- **Clothing Recognition**: Considers actual clothing colors and styles in the transformation
- **Composition Integrity**: Keeps the original photo booth composition and framing
- **Personalized Results**: Each transformation is unique to the actual captured photo
